The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if there's a syntax error within the `calc()` expression, it can lead to unexpected results or the entire CSS rule being ignored.  For example, forgetting a space between operators or using incompatible units can cause issues.

```css
/* Incorrect: Missing space between + and 10px */
width:calc(50%+10px);

/* Incorrect: Mixing percentages and ems without proper nesting */
font-size: calc(100% + 1em); 

/* Correct */
width: calc(50% + 10px);
font-size: calc(100% + 1em);
```
